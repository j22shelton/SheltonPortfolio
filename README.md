This portfolio is based on a combination of GA Tech Bootcamp homework assignments and Projects.

The Global Retirement Calculator project requires the use of an Moesif Orign & CORS Changer extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/Cors?hl=en
Please note after installing, it must be switched "On" at the top right of the webpage for the project to work correctly.
